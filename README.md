This is driver for display board from "Superior" DVD Player, board have yellow-orange display and few buttons. Everything is connected to TM1628 .

This is a code archive that I moved from my google drive, so no support and I don't really remember this :smile: .

Here is video from test: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igxRnuw4wBk
MCU=ATMega32 , F_CPU=8MHz .

I've written this using old WinAVR, so makefile probably will work with it only.
But it shuld work with AVR Studio after adding code files to project... (I didn't tested it).
